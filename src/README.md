# Academy word document conversion tool
Tool to convert the documents used by the RGI Acedemy to produce the interactive courses to a slide notes format.

Run the tool following the [instuctions](./README_run.md)

Test the tool via Pytest.

## Result achieved

Slides described in a tabular format like this

![slide_table_format](../assets/images/slide_table_format.png)

are converted into this format

![slide_notes_format](../assets/images/slide_notes_format.png)

The table of content remains unchanged

![table_of_content](../assets/images/headings.png)


## Conversion logic
### Slides
A slide is identified by a table whose first cell in the first row has "ID ðŸ”’".

The slide notes content is taken from the third cell of the row whose second cell has the value "Slide Notes". If the table does not have a row whose second value is "Slide Notes", then the content is the concatenation of the third cells of all other rows.

### Paragraphs and Headings
Paragraphs whose style is either "Heading 1" or "Titolo 11" are considered top paragraphs which refer to a group of slides and not a specific slides.

Paragraphs which have a different style are considered to refer to a specific slide and their content becomes the title of the slide.

### Images
Images are extracted by zipping the word document and then extracting all files contained in the "word/media/" folder in the zip file.
